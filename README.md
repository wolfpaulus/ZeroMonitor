# ZeroMonitor

Using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for hardware monitoring

_-1st prototype of ZeroMonitor with two 8-NeoPixels sticks-_

ZeroMonitor is a lightweight, customizable system monitor built for Raspberry Pi. 
It checks the health of remote computers agentless (via SSH) and visualizes the results 
using a strip of NeoPixels ‚Äî one (or more) Pixels per host.

### Highlights
- Remote monitoring with SSH (secure, non-invasive, no agents required)
- Real-time visual feedback using NeoPixels
- Alternative display options using an (e-paper) which updates every 2 minutes
- Customizable modular design (clean OOP in Python) ‚Äî easy to add new monitors
- CI/CD-style automatic updates with a simple polling strategy (cron):
  - Check for updates from GitHub
  - Redeploy itself if an update is available

## Example Monitors
- CPU temperature
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Disk space

## Visual feedback via NeoPixels (e.g.):
- Blue: low/idle
- Turquoise: below normal
- Green: medium/normal
- Orange: above medium
- Red: high
- Pink: critical
- Black/off: offline

## How It Works
The Pi connects to the monitored hosts over SSH.
Gathers system metrics using remote commands.
Evaluates thresholds and maps state to color.
Updates the corresponding NeoPixel LED.

### ./.ssh/config
To simplify SSH connections, you can set up your `~/.ssh/config` file with the following entries:

#### Example SSH Config
```plaintext
Host alpha
    User wolf
    Port 22
    HostName 192.168.200.16
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host beta
    User wolf
    Port 22
    HostName 192.168.200.17
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Depending on the display you want to use, you need to install different libraries.

# üîÑ CI/CD-Style Auto-Update
ZeroMonitor can automatically check for updates from GitHub and redeploy itself using a cron job.
For more details, see the [./cicd/README.md](cicd/README.md) file.
## Ansible Playbook
This ansible playbook can be used to install ZeroMonitor on a Raspberry Pi:
